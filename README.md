# StateFarm-Sentiment

Sort-Dataset branch sorts the base_data.csv into three categories. 

The mobile dataset, natural disaster dataset, and state farm.

The state farm dataset is exlusive of the natural disaster data and mobile data. 

File datasetsort.py takes in the cleaned_data.csv, and returns three new .csv files. 
Mobile.csv, statefarm.csv, and naturaldisasters.csv
